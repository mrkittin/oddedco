	<p class="c0"><span class="c3">We now know that what unites us is vastly more important than what divides us.</span></p>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c5">(Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development 'Our Common Future'. United Nations, 1987)</span></p>
	<p class="c4">Since ancient times we, the humankind, are being developed not just because it’s a natural way of evolution, but because we are triggered by our needs. It all started because of the need for food and place to sleep. As we needed communication - art has appeared. To get more nutritious food and eliminate hunger we have created efficient hunting tools. Humans have started building houses because of the need for safety and comfort.</p>
	<p class="c4">After thousands of years of evolution, we obtained machines and weaponry, crowned our kings and governments to defend our stability. Having evolved till basic needs were met, we started making wars. Centuries later we continue nurturing the paradigm, according to which money and power to index top life’s achievement. This is a self-supportive system offering no retreat as we pursue comfort.
	</p>
	<p class="c4">These are the layers of our so-called evolution. Industrial revolution has brought nuclear bomb, computers and internet, lifting science and technology to a new level. On the other hand modern tech age resulted in iPhone, self-driving car and software boom. But eventually this is a revolution of marketing, consumption and engineering at its residue. New layers seem to become thinner and thinner when speaking of innovations.</p>
	<p class="c4">Startups claim their role in changing the world. Still the majority of modern businesses are driven by material profit. What is intended to move our society forward, however, exists within the mentioned paradigm. “Alternatives” in a closer look appear to be the elements of the same system.</p>
	<p class="c4">We haven’t had anything that humanity imagined and fantasized about for the 2000s-era like outer space expeditions, telepathy, teleportation yet.  Is it because we’re not smart enough or simply not ready? Our most brilliant minds work for corporations, governments, serve in armies - for everything that exists just for someone’s wealth and control purposes. The rest of us is still struggling for basic needs, health care, human rights respect and peaceful coexistence.</p>
	<p class="c4">At the same time a big portion of population with access to social networks and online education expands before our eyes. Everyone’s chance to become someone significant and to bring value to the world has increased. And since a new layer of human development is not formed yet, in order to make the world a better place we may consider a profound deliberate re-evaluation of what each of us spends his best efforts on.</p>
	<p class="c4">We are here to displace stereotypes and biases. Yet we are hackers, digital nomads, artists, musicians, alt-scientists, startuppers, volunteers, the new medium. Working together we are more likely to become majority. Together we create a whole new means and meaning of evolution.</p>
	<p class="c4">We hereby declare our commitment to: </p>
	<ol class="c7" start="1">
		<li class="c6">Spread our ideas across the world setting new trends of positive global changes;</li>
		<li class="c6">Dedicate our time to work on the projects that help people think and aspire for better; </li>
		<li class="c6">Create new types of jobs and new kinds of volunteer opportunities. </li>
	</ol>
